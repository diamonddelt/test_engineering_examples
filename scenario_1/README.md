# Notes
1. This scenario obviously intends to test how one can automate AngularJS UIs using Selenium. Since I am not a strong Javascript developer, and have little experience with both AngularJS and ProtractorJS, this is easily the most difficult scenario. I'd like to say I could wrap this up in a weekend, but the reality would be I would need a lot more time to ramp up my skills in the above areas to do it in ProtractorJS
