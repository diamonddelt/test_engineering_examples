# System Requirements
1. Install node.js, npm, protractorjs, webdriver-manager, and ensure they are all accessible on the system PATH
2. (optional) Install a good terminal program to multiplex two terminal windows

# Running the scenario
1. cd into the 'selenium_saucelabs_configurator' directory
2. $ webdriver-manager start
3. Open a new terminal window in the same directory as above
4. $ protractorjs conf.js

# Notes
1. This example intends to test how one can automate AngularJS UIs using Selenium. Since I am not a strong Javascript developer, and have little experience with both AngularJS and ProtractorJS, I expect a lot of room for improvement in this example. Just trying to do something rather simple like this with both a language I am weak with, as well as a test framework I have never used, proves to be quite challenging to me.
